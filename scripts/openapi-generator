# Shell script to launch openapi-generator on Unix systems.  Mostly borrowed from
# ArgoUML which borrowed from the Apache Ant project.
#
# The idea is that you can put a softlink in your "bin" directory back
# to this file in the ArgoUML install directory and this script will
# use the link to find the jars that it needs, e.g.:
#

## resolve links - $0 may be a link to openapi-generator's home
