[OpenAPI Generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) is a code generator that supports generation of
API client libraries, server stubs and documentation automatically
given an [OpenAPI Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification).

The Ada client support has been integrated in [OpenAPI Generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator).

The OpenAPI Ada library is a small support library for the Ada code generator
provided by OpenAPI Generator.  The library provides support to serialize the data,
make HTTP requests and support the [OpenAPI Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification).
specific operations or types.

## Build and installation

The OpenAPI Ada library provides support for client and server.  The client part has
less constraints than the server part which needs more components.  For both parts,
before building this library, you may need to install the following projects:

* Ada Util      (https://github.com/stcarrez/ada-util)
* Ada Security  (https://github.com/stcarrez/ada-security)
* AWS      (https://libre.adacore.com/libre/tools/aws/)
* XMLAda   (https://libre.adacore.com/libre/tools/xmlada/)

If you also need to server part, you must also install the following components:

* Ada EL        (https://github.com/stcarrez/ada-el)
* Ada Servlet   (https://github.com/stcarrez/ada-servlet)

Then, to build OpenAPI Ada library, configure as follows:
```
./configure
make
```

And if you want the server part, configure and build with:
```
./configure --enable-server
make
```

For the installation, use the following command:
```
make install
```

The git repository comes with a pre-compiled [OpenAPI Generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator)
that will be installed in `/usr/local/share/swagger-ada/openapi-generator-cli.jar`.  To help in launching the
generator, a script is installed in `/usr/local/bin/openapi-generator`.  You must have a Java JRE installed
to be able to run the generator.

## Docker

A docker container is available for those who want to try OpenAPI Ada without installing
and building all required packages.  To use the OpenAPI Ada docker container you can
run the following commands:

```
sudo docker pull ciceron/openapi-ada
```

## Using OpenAPI Ada

### Generating the REST client from OpenAPI Spec

The command to generate an Ada REST client is the following:
```
  openapi-generator generate --generator-name ada -i my-api.yaml \
       --additional-properties projectName=MyProject \
       --model-package MyProject.MyModule -o client
```
where *my-api.yaml* is the OpenAPI specification file that describes your API,
*MyProject* is the name of the GNAT project to use,
*MyProject.MyModule* is the name of the Ada package that will be the parent
package of the generated Ada packages.

The generator will create several files in *client/src/client* with basically
two packages: *MyProject.MyModule*.Models and *MyProject.MyModule*.Clients.
The **Models** child package will contain the type definitions for the
API operations describes in the YAML file and the **Clients** child package
will contain the *Client_Type* tagged record with the API operations to
invoke the REST API.

For example, if the YAML description file contains the following API
operation:
```
paths:
  '/pet/{petId}':
    get:
      tags:
        - pet
      summary: Find pet by ID
      description: Returns a single pet
      operationId: getPetById
      produces:
        - application/xml
        - application/json
      parameters:
        - name: petId
          in: path
          description: ID of pet to return
          required: true
          type: integer
          format: int64
      responses:
        '200':
          description: successful operation
          schema:
            $ref: '#/definitions/Pet'
        '400':
          description: Invalid ID supplied
        '404':
          description: Pet not found
      security:
        - api_key: []
definitions:
  Pet:
    title: a Pet
    description: A pet for sale in the pet store
    type: object
    required:
      - name
      - photoUrls
    properties:
      id:
        type: integer
        format: int64
      category:
        $ref: '#/definitions/Category'
      name:
        type: string
        example: doggie
      photoUrls:
        type: array
        xml:
          name: photoUrl
          wrapped: true
        items:
          type: string
      tags:
        type: array
        xml:
          name: tag
          wrapped: true
        items:
          $ref: '#/definitions/Tag'
      status:
        type: string
        description: pet status in the store
        enum:
          - available
          - pending
          - sold
    xml:
      name: Pet
```

The generator will generate the following Ada code in the *Models* child package:
```
package Samples.Petstore.Models is
   ...
   type Pet_Type is
     record
       Id : Swagger.Long;
       Category : Samples.Petstore.Models.Category_Type;
       Name : Swagger.UString;
       Photo_Urls : Swagger.UString_Vectors.Vector;
       Tags : Samples.Petstore.Models.Tag_Type_Vectors.Vector;
       Status : Swagger.UString;
     end record;
     ...
end Samples.Petstore.Models;
```

and the following code in the *Clients* child package:

```
package Samples.Petstore.Clients is
   ...
   type Client_Type is new Swagger.Clients.Client_Type with null record;
   procedure Get_Pet_By_Id
      (Client : in out Client_Type;
       Pet_Id : in Swagger.Long;
       Result : out Samples.Petstore.Models.Pet_Type);
   ...
end Samples.Petstore.Clients;
```

### Initialization

The HTTP/REST support is provided by [Ada Util](https://github.com/stcarrez/ada-util)
and encapsulated by [OpenAPI Ada](https://github.com/stcarrez/swagger-ada).  If you want
to use Curl, you should initialize with the following:

```
   Util.Http.Clients.Curl.Register;
```

But if you want to use [AWS](https://libre.adacore.com/libre/tools/aws/), you will initialize with:

```
   Util.Http.Clients.AWS.Register;
```

Curl may be easier to start with because [AWS](https://libre.adacore.com/libre/tools/aws/)
does not support HTTP DELETE operation except in some latest version.

After the initialization is done, you will declare a client instance to access
the API operations:

```
   C : Samples.Petstore.Clients.Client_Type;
```

The 'Client_Type' is the generated type that will implement the operations
described in the OpenAPI description file.

And you should initialize the server base URI you want to connect to:

```
  C.Set_Server ("http://petstore.swagger.io/v2");
```

At this stage, you can use the generated operation.

### Calling an operation

Let's retrieve some pet information by calling the 'Get_Pet_By_Id' operation.
This operation needs an integer as input parameter and returns a 'Pet_Type'
object that contains all the pet information.   You will first declare
the pet instance as follows:

```
  Pet  : Samples.Petstore.Models.Pet_Type;
```

And then call the 'Get_Pet_By_Id' operation:

```
  C.Get_Pet_By_Id (768, Pet);
```

At this stage, you can access information from the 'Pet' instance:

```
  Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line ("Id      : " & Swagger.Long'Image (Pet.Id));
  Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line ("Name    : " & Swagger.To_String (Pet.Name));
  Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line ("Status  : " & Swagger.To_String (Pet.Status));
```
